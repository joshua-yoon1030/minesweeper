# minesweeper

- Demo: https://joshua-yoon1030.github.io/minesweeper/

In this project, I built the classic game, Minesweeper. The objective of this project was to learn a little bit more about how html, css, and javascript all tie in together. Some technical skills demonstrated are on click handlers, css classes, html elements, BFS.

Patch 1.1 - Right Clicking Rumble
NEW PATCH UPDATE WOOHOO!!!!
Added functionality for right click: now if you have flagged enough squares to match the number, if you click on the number, it will clear all surrounding squares for you.
Additionally, if you right click a square that is originally unclicked, it will flag it for you
Finally, made the game slightly more challenging
